                    <p> My art is a deeply personal and expressive part of my life. Growing up painting, I can hardly remember a day in my childhood when I was not creating. As I got older, life took over and I stopped. For over 20 years I painted nothing and saw little value in it. I saw my art as a “hobby” that I simply did not have time to indulge. During a very dark time in my life, I was blessed with the divine instruction to paint again and was gifted with an understanding of God’s true purpose for art. It provides yet another channel of Love to His creation. Artists, in their purist form, are conduits of this Love and are blessed both through and by this transfer.</p>

                    <p> In her encaustic and oil paintings, Ellen DeLoach works the surface of her artworks with great care, developing layers of color and texture that yield dense images spanning the figurative and abstract, and often coming close to pure Color Field painting. DeLoach’s work attests to a special interest in the Old Testament’s “Book of Ruth,” which addresses themes of kindness and one’s moral, familial duties. “I hope my viewers see these women not as victims, but as survivors who may have seen tough things in their lives but have overcome it and grown and moved on,” she says. Her works invite comparison with other artists interested in themes of memory and survival, such as Sam Francis, Joan Mitchell, and Anselm Kiefer.</p>
