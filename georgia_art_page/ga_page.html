                    <p>I've written about my work in Artist's Magazine, and am a featured illustrator and interviewee in the publication; "Exploring Illustration" by Michael Fleishman, as well as "The Big Book of Illustration Ideas" by Roger Walton. My work was the subject of a column titled "Image" in New York Newsday.
                        In 1995, I became interested in printmaking and received a Kuniyoshi Scholarship to study under the late Robert Angeloch at the Woodstock School of Art in Woodstock, New York. 
                        For a few years, I balanced two disciplines: commercial illustration and printmaking. Then, after over 20 years as an illustrator, I began to shift more attention to printmaking and painting. I've since been chosen in more than 70 juried exhibitions and am represented in multiple galleries throughout the Southeast. </p>
